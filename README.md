# GoAuth2
An Oauth2 Server written in Golang and licensed under the GPL V3 license.

This will be a golang version of <a href="https://github.com/Ulbora/nodeJsOauth2Server" target="_blank">nodeJsOauth2Server</a>.
It will use the same exact database and provide all Oauth 2 Grant types.

This server should run behind nginx and nginx should handle certs.
